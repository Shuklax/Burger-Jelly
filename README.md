<!-- there are many types of testing eg., QA testing etc
QA testing is a type of testing that is performed by a Quality Assurance (QA) team to ensure
that the software meets the required quality standards. QA testing involves testing the software
to identify defects, bugs, and other issues that may affect its functionality, performance, and usability.

Other testing which the developer can do: 
without code -> manual testing the app
with code -> Unit testing, integration testing, End-to-End testing aka e2e testing -->

<!-- The react testing library which is based on DOM- testing  library uses JEST behind the scene. 
And jest is a javascript testing framework. It works on projects using babel, TS, JS, JSX, 
node, angular, vue etc -->


<!-- # Setting up testing in our app
 - Install React testing library
 - Install Jest
 - Install babel dependencies
 - Configure Babel
 - Configure Parcel config file to disable default babel transpilation in parcel
 (so it doesn't conflict with babel.config.js file configurations) -->
